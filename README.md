## Experiences

During my career I had chance to work on many different projects. From small personal project to big corporate applications that had to serve thousands of customers.

As all projects were unique, I encountered many different challenges, but I was always able to find a solution or negotiate good compromise to satisfy all interested parties.

In the list below are some of my work experiences or projects that I had privilege to be a part of.


### Uniqa.at ***(OCT 2020 - Present)***

At Uniqa.at I had a chance to work on their customer portal MyUniqa. Later I have been transferred to work on transforming theirs internal applications. I work in a frontend team consisting of 3 FE developer, where I am the lead developer. Our goal is to introduce new sustainable technology and improve UX and UI.


### Revolt.city ***(DEC 2020 - JUL 2021)***
For the Revolt.city I had a chance to develop mobile application for theirs servicemen. It was build using the latest trends in Hybrid development such as Angular, Ionic 5 and Capacitor.

Usage of those technologies allowed fast delivery of the application and reduced the cost of development and maintenance compared to the native counterparts.

### USU Software s.r.o. ***(JUL 2017 - JUL 2020)***
USU is a big corporation, that develops many different products/solutions. I had a chance to work on BI tool that helped improve ETL processes build with Angular using Angular Material components.

Later, when the company was consolidating their different sister companies under one brand, I initiated movement to introduce WebComponents to unify the UI easily as the company used many different technologies for each of theirs products. I became lead developer for the Design System. We chose Stencil.Js as the technology for building those WebComponents and it was a joy to work with it.

### FlowUp s.r.o. ***(JUL 2019 - JUN 2020)***
FlowUp as a company focused on developing Cloud Based applications (Google Partner). They embraced development communities and organised regular public meetups mostly focused on Angular and I am happy that I had a chance to be part of that as well. I had a chance to attend 2 Firebase conferences, one in Prague, the other in Madrid.

The project I worked on there was UK based fin-tech startup Dashly, that aims to give people better understanding over their current mortgage or helps to find better deal for them. I was mostly responsible for removing technological debt as well as developing new features. I gained there a lot of practical knowledge especially of Firebase related tools.

### Pindex.sk ***(MAR 2014 - JUL 2016)***
Pindex.sk is professional network for students and teachers of universities and high schools in Slovakia. Where the students could share their notes about teachers and give them a grades based on some objective metrics. It was indeed interesting experience to work on that project especially because by that time I was a student my self.

I rewrote their platform to a new standards using up to date versions of Laravel with performance in mind. It was wonderful experience because I had to implement pixel perfect design given me by the very skilled designer.
